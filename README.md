# Hello World (ArcGIS Runtime SDK for OSX)
A quick OSX map-based app using the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for OSX

Each commit marks a stage during the build-out of the app.

1. Create a new Single View App and install the ArcGIS Runtime SDK pod
2. Add a basemap, zoom to DC, and add some CCTV cameras (from [Open Data DC](http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/99d13287b85240b89bd46b2aa89e1acf_11))

See the [iOS Walkthrough](https://github.com/nixta/hello-world-arcgis-runtime-ios) for more details

This was used during the "ArcGIS Runtime SDKs: Building Apple Apps" technical session at [DevSummit DC 2015](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit-dc).
